Please only use this package if your distribution is not officially supported
and we do not provide a package for it. 

If you just need to quickly start a support session, you are fine to run the
binary file "anydesk" out of the archive (dependencies are at the end of the
README).

If you need additional features like connecting to your login screen, user
switching, etc, we recommend installing the global service. To achieve this, you
 need to install the "anydesk" binary to a location of your choice (we recommend
 using "/usr/local/bin"), copy the polkit action to your polkits policy folder
(default: "/usr/share/polkit-1/actions", please consult your distros manual) and
 copy either the systemd service file or the init.d service file to the place
your distro uses (see distros manual as these locations might differ), edit this
 file to point to the correct binary path for AnyDesk and then enable and start
the service.
Alternatively, you can use install.sh bash script which will automatically
install anydesk to default/recommended locations for you. But please note that
it might not work for some very specific distros; also only systemd is supported.
For usage/help run the script without args: ./install.sh
